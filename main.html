        <h1>SHARKS</h1>
        <h4>Sharks are some of the oldest and most impressive predators in the ocean. They have been in the seas for over 400 million years. These interesting cartilaginous fish are not just top hunters; they also play important roles in keeping marine ecosystems healthy worldwide. There are more than 500 known species of sharks, showing a remarkable variety in size, shape, and habitat. From the huge whale shark, the largest fish in the world, to the small dwarf lanternshark, the variety is striking. Unlike bony fish, sharks have skeletons made of cartilage, which is flexible and lighter.

Their sensory abilities are truly remarkable. Sharks can detect prey from great distances. They have an excellent sense of smell and can pick up a single drop of blood in an Olympic-sized swimming pool. They also have a special sense called electroreception, which uses organs known as Ampullae of Lorenzini. These organs help them sense faint electrical fields created by living creatures, even those buried in the sand. Their vision is also highly developed, especially in low-light situations, thanks to a reflective layer behind the retina.

Sharks are essential to the ocean's food web. They typically prey on sick, old, or weak individuals. This natural selection helps keep prey populations healthy. Different species have specific diets, ranging from plankton and crustaceans to fish and marine mammals. Many sharks hunt alone, but some, like hammerheads, can be found in large groups. Their reproductive strategies vary widely, including laying eggs, giving live birth, and ovoviviparity.

Unfortunately, many shark populations now face serious threats. Overfishing, driven by the demand for fins, meat, and liver oil, is a major concern. Habitat destruction and accidental capture in fishing gear, known as bycatch, also contribute to their decline. Conservation efforts are essential to protect these amazing creatures and the health of our oceans. Protecting sharks helps maintain the delicate balance of marine life for future generations. Education and responsible tourism, such as shark diving, can promote appreciation and support for their survival. Every effort to understand and protect sharks leads to a healthier planet.</h4>
